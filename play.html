    <h4>ACT IV._Morning-room in Lord Windermere’s</h4>
    <h5> LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
    <p>[_Lying on sofa_.] </p>
    <p>How can I tell him? I can’t tell
        him. It would kill me. I wonder what happened after I escaped from that
        horrible room. Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there,
        and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine. Oh, if he knows—how can
        I look him in the face again? He would never forgive me.
        How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation,
        sin, folly. And then suddenly—Oh! Life is terrible. It rules us, we do
        not rule it.</p>
    <p>[_Enter_ ROSALIE _R._]</p>

    <h5>ROSALIE.</h5>
    <p>Did your ladyship ring for me?</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
    <p>Yes. Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere
        came in last night?</p>

    <h5>ROSALIE.</h5>
    <p> lordship did not come in till five o’clock.</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
    <p>Five o’clock? He knocked at my door this morning,
        didn’t he?</p>

    <h5>ROSALIE.</h5>
    <p> Yes, my lady—at half-past nine. I told him your ladyship was
        not awake yet.</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
    <p> Did he say anything?</p>

    <h5>ROSALIE.</h5>
    <p>Something about your ladyship’s fan. I didn’t quite catch what
        his lordship said. Has the fan been lost, my lady? I can’t find it, and
        Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms. He has looked in all of
        them and on the terrace as well.</p>

    <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
    <p> It doesn’t matter. Tell Parker not to trouble. That
        will do.</p>

    <p> [_Exit_ ROSALIE.]</p>
